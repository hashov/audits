# Introduction

A time-boxed security review of the first-flight **Puppy-Raffle** protocol was done by **hashov**, focused on the security aspects of the application's implementation.

# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review cannot ensure the total elimination of vulnerabilities. This process is limited by time, resources, and expertise, as I strive to identify as many vulnerabilities as I can for the given timeframe. I cannot promise 100% absolute security post-review or guarantee the discovery of any issues in your smart contracts. It is highly advised to conduct additional security reviews, implement bug bounty programs, and engage in on-chain monitoring for enhanced protection.

# About **Puppy-Raffle**

Link to the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Cyfrin/4-puppy-raffle-audit).

Is a protocol which is to enter a raffle to win a cute dog NFT. The protocol should do the following:

1. Call the `enterRaffle` function with the following parameters:
   1. `address[] participants`: A list of addresses that enter. You can use this to enter yourself multiple times, or yourself and a group of your friends.
2. Duplicate addresses are not allowed
3. Users are allowed to get a refund of their ticket & `value` if they call the `refund` function
4. Every X seconds, the raffle will be able to draw a winner and be minted a random puppy
5. The owner of the protocol will set a feeAddress to take a cut of the `value`, and the rest of the funds will be sent to the winner of the puppy.

# Detailed Findings

# [C-01] Possible reentrancy inside `refund` function

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it results in 100% loss for funds of targeted players inside the protocol

**Likelihood:**
High, as any user of `Puppi Raffle` with malicious intention can interact violently with the contract.

## Description
Function `refund()` uses `payable(msg.sender).sendValue` coming from `openZeppelin` library, which is a great way to surpass the Solidityâ€™s `transfer()` and `send()` methods from running out of gas,
but still this line is open to reentrancy. If the calling contract does not have a way to handle 
native currency, `fallback()` will be called therefore giving him the opportunity to reenter before execution of `refund()` finishes. Of course with the usage of arbitrary `playerIndex` and sequential calls to `refund()` attacker can withdraw players funds out of the contract.

## Recommendations
Add reentrancy guard modifier such as:
```solidity
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
```
 or do all state changes before doing the call.

# [C-02] Possible reentrancy inside `selectWinner` function

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as it results in 100% loss of `prizePool` funds

**Likelihood:**
High, as any user of `Puppi Raffle` protocol with malicious intention can interact violently with the contract.

## Description
Function `selectWinner()` uses `winner.call{value: prizePool}("")` before doing state changes making it open to reentrancy. If the calling contract does not have a way to handle 
native currency, `fallback()` will be called therefore giving him the opportunity to reenter and do damage.

## Recommendations
Add reentrancy guard modifier such as:
```solidity
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
```
 or do all state changes before doing the call.

# [H-01] Denial of service inside `enterRiffle` function on iteration with nested loops over array

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as the contract usage will be totally inefficient.

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone with malicious intend can call `enterRaffle()` with huge non-duplicating array, making the protocol inefficient.

## Description
The contract stops being usable if malicious user
calls `enterRaffle()` with huge non-duplicating array and `newPlayers` array would be really heavy on the following piece of code on line 81:

```solidity
// Check for duplicates
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```
making it big enough and gas expensive therefore making transactions fail and making it unusable.

## Recommendations
1. First do the duplicate player entry check and then add people to the players array then add test case for that, this way you will minimalize the risk of someone maliciously filling up your array, but in future at some point the array will potentially get large enough to cause problems.
2. Usage of:
`mapping(address => uint256) public addressToRaffleId;` in conjuction with `uint256 public raffleId = 0;` is encouraged. This solution will give instant check if someone who is trying to enter is a duplicate and we will solve gas efficiency problems.

# [H-02] Mishandling of ETH inside `withdrawFees`

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, as the contract usage will be totally inefficient.

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone with malicious intend can call `enterRaffle` with huge non-duplicating array, making the protocol inefficient.

## Description
Since the contract does not have implemented `fallback()` or `receive()` methods a potential attacker can force eth inside of 
the contract with `selfdestruct()` function and the following check inside `withdrawFees()` would always fail:

```solidity
require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```
this will lead to failing of the given assertion always when someone tries to withdraw, therefore nobody will be able to withdraw native token from the contract.

## Recommendations
Don't rely on `address(this).balance` instead of, make usage of storage variable such as: `uint256 public balance;`

# [M-01] Weak randomness inside `selectWinner` function, cause of `block.timestamp` usage

## Severity

**Impact:**
Low, as it will not have any impact on the contract itself but it will mislead client of the contract.

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone has the chance to not be included in the raffle.

## Description
Using `block.timestamp` inside of `selectWinner()` on line 126:

```solidity 
  uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
```    
for source of randomness can always be manipulated by attacker, cause the number can be guessed by using the same formula.

## Recommendations
As a solution usage of Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) might be preferable.

# [M-02] Possible overflow on `fees` variable

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, owner of contract will receive 0 `fees` if variable overflows.

**Likelihood:**
High, as the maximum number of `uint64` is not high enough to hold, large volume of fees.

## Description
Overflow on `totalFees` storage variable is possible, cause the number of fees depends on how many people are in the raffle, meaning it can surpass the max value of `uint64`,
and since the solidity version is less than version `^0.8` it means that a check for surpass won't be present and owner of contract will receive 0 fees if it overflows.

## Recommendations
1. Newer version of solidity
2. `Openzeppin`'s `SafeMath` library
3. `uint256` usage instead of `uint64`

# [M-03] Unsafe casting from `uint256` to `uint64`

## Severity

**Impact:**
High, owner of contract will receive 0 `fees` if variable overflows.

**Likelihood:**
High, as the maximum number of `uint64` is not high enough to hold, large volume of fees.

## Description
Inside of `electWinner()` line 132:

```solidity 
        totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
```
as shown `totalFees` fee is getting casted and will lose value due to that.

## Recommendations
Remove the casting.

# [M-04] Weak randomness inside `selectWinner` function, cause of `block.difficulty` usage

## Severity

**Impact:**
Low, as it will not have any impact on the contract itself but it will mislead client of the contract.

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone has the chance to not be included in the raffle.

## Description
Using `block.difficulty` for the rarity calculation inside of `selectWinner()` on line: 137:

```solidity
        uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
```
for source of randomness always can be manipulated, cause the number can be guessed by using the same formula.

## Recommendations
As a solution usage of Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) might be preferable.

# [L-01] The `getActivePlayerIndex` function returns 0 if player is not active

## Severity

**Impact:**
Low, as it will not have any impact on the contract itself but it will mislead client of the contract.

**Likelihood:**
High, as anyone has the chance to not be included in the raffle.

## Description
the `getActivePlayerIndex()` function returns 0 if player is not active, what if player is at index 0? He might think he is not active at all.

```solidity
require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```
this will lead to failing of the given assertion always when someone tries to withdraw, therefore nobody will be able to withdraw native token from the contract.

## Recommendations
Consider using custom exception for example:
```solidity 
    function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        revert PlayerNotActive();
    }
```
# [I-01] Immutable variables naming convention

## Severity
Informational

## Description
Following best practices immutable variables such as

```solidity 
uint256 public immutable entranceFee;
```
should start with `i_` example: `i_entranceFee`.

## Recommendations
Applying best practices.

# [I-02] Prefer usage of `msg.sender` instead `address` parameter inside constructor

## Severity
Informational

## Description
Instead of passing the address in the constructor since the one who will deploy the contract (owner) is the one who will get the winnings better to offload the constructor from the parameter to go with: 

```solidity 
feeAddress = msg.sender;
```
## Recommendations
Applying best practices.

# [I-03] Consider usage of Solidity version over `0.8.*` and floating pragma removal

## Severity
Informational

## Description
Increase version to solidity `0.8.*` to throw an exception if overflow/underflow occurs, also using floating pragma is a bad practice, since we want to know exactly with what version of solidity we are working.

## Recommendations
Applying best practices.
